# Infini.Py

InfiniPy is a Synchronous API Wrapper for [Infinity Bot List](https://infinitybots.gg)  
At the point of writing this (9.10.22), the Library is fully compatible with Infinity Bot List's API v5.  
Updates will follow.

## Get Started
First, to initialize your Bot, you need to get a Bot's Stats. Here we use
```py
from infinipy import fetch_bot

my_bot = fetch_bot(123456) # Your ID Here
```
